# REQ.UNIVERSAL: Spec repositories MUST ignore editor, OS, and transient artifacts.
# WHY: Prevent accidental commits of local or generated noise.
# ALT: Expand only if the repository adds tooling that generates artifacts.

# === OS artifacts ===
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# === Editor artifacts ===
*.swp
*.swo
*.bak
*~
.vscode/
.idea/

# === Temporary files ===
.tmp/
.temp/

# === LaTeX build artifacts (if SPEC is rendered locally) ===
*.aux
*.bbl
*.blg
*.log
*.out
*.toc
*.fls
*.fdb_latexmk

# === PDF previews ===
*.pdf

# === Proof assistant artifacts (defensive, non-binding) ===
*.olean
*.ilean
*.trace
.lake/
