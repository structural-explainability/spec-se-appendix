# WHY-FILE: Normalize line endings and GitHub language classification
# to ensure cross-platform consistency and predictable CI behavior.

# === Core: Text normalization ===
* text=auto

# WHY-SECTION: Explicit EOL rules avoid platform-specific diffs and tool failures.

# === Scripts ===
# Python and shell scripts must always use LF (CI, Linux, macOS, containers)
*.py  text eol=lf
*.sh  text eol=lf

# PowerShell scripts follow Windows convention
*.ps1 text eol=crlf

# === Docs and configs ===
# Cross-platform; tooling expects LF
*.md   text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.yml  text eol=lf
*.json text eol=lf
*.toml text eol=lf

# === GitHub Linguist ===
# Improve language statistics and UI without affecting builds

# Jupyter notebooks: custom diff/merge drivers (if configured)
