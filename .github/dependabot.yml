# REQ.PROJECT: This repository SHOULD track GitHub Actions updates automatically.
# WHY: GitHub Actions are executable dependencies and may receive security or behavior updates.
# OBS: This repository has no language-level dependencies (Python, JS, Rust, etc.).
# OBS: GitHub Actions are the only dependency class currently in scope.
# ALT: Dependabot could be omitted if workflows are pinned and reviewed manually.
# CUSTOM: Update interval if CI cadence or security posture changes.

version: 2

updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "github-actions"
    directory: "/"

    # WHY: Monthly cadence balances stability with security updates.
    # ALT: Use "weekly" for higher-security environments.
    schedule:
      interval: "monthly"

    # WHY: Clear commit prefix simplifies changelog review and filtering.
    commit-message:
      prefix: "(deps)"
