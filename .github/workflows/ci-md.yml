# WHY-FILE: Minimal checks for repositories where hygiene is the primary gate.
# OBS: CI does not introduce additional style rules beyond repo configuration.
# NOTE: This workflow intentionally avoids requiring Python or pre-commit for contributors.

name: CI Hygiene (Markdown and YAML)

# WHY: Validate repo contents on pushes to main branch and pull requests.

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run when pushing to main branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run on pull requests targeting main branch.
  workflow_dispatch: # WHY: Allow manual triggering from Actions tab.

permissions: # WHY: Use least privileges required.
  contents: read

jobs:
  ci:
    name: Repository checks (pre-commit)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # WHY: Linux environment matches most production deployments
    timeout-minutes: 10 # WHY: Prevent hanging jobs. If over, it is likely stuck.

    steps:
      # ============================================================
      # ASSEMBLE: Get code

      # BASIC CHECKS: Run basic checks

      - name: B2) Lint YAML (uses .yamllint.yml)
        # WHY: Validate YAML correctness using repo-defined yamllint.yml rules.
        # OBS: Ensures GitHub Actions YAML and other YAML files remain valid.
        uses: ibiqlik/action-yamllint@v3

          no_warnings: true         # WHY: CI output should be actionable.
