# SOURCE: https://github.com/denisecase/templates
#
# WHY-FILE: Minimal checks for repositories where hygiene is the primary gate.
# REQ: Any check that can be run locally MUST be available locally via pre-commit.
# REQ: CI MUST NOT introduce arbitrary rules that are not reproducible locally.
# OBS: CI does not introduce additional style rules beyond repo configuration.

name: CI Hygiene

# WHY: Validate repo contents on pushes to main branch and pull requests.

on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run when pushing to main branch.
  pull_request:
    branches: [main] # WHY: Run on pull requests targeting main branch.
  workflow_dispatch: # WHY: Allow manual triggering from Actions tab.

permissions: # WHY: Use least privileges required.
  contents: read

env:
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1" # WHY: Real-time logging.
  PYTHONIOENCODING: "utf-8" # WHY: Ensure UTF-8 encoding for international characters.

jobs:
  ci:
    name: Repository checks (pre-commit)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # WHY: Linux environment matches most production deployments
    timeout-minutes: 10 # WHY: Prevent hanging jobs. If over, it is likely stuck.

    steps:
      # ============================================================
      # ASSEMBLE: Get code and set up environment
      # ============================================================

      - name: 1) Checkout repository code
        # WHY: Needed to access files for checks.
        uses: actions/checkout@v6

      - name: 2) Run pre-commit (all files)
        # WHY: Single source of truth for locally runnable quality gates.
        # OBS: Fails if hooks would modify files; does not commit changes.
        id: precommit # WHY: Identify step for conditional follow-up.
