> Structural Explainability Appendix Template.

## Overview

This repository provides an **informative appendix template** for use with
Structural Explainability (SE)-aligned specifications, papers, datasets,
and implementations.

An SE appendix records **disclosure, context, interpretive claims, reuse conditions,
and provenance** associated with a contribution, without asserting correctness,
truth, authority, or endorsement.

The appendix is **not normative** and does not introduce new constraints.
It exists to support precise reference, reuse, and disagreement downstream.

## Purpose

The purpose of the SE Appendix is to:

- make interpretive context explicit without embedding it in the neutral substrate
- separate observations from claims about their meaning
- enable attribution, contestability, and reuse without forcing agreement
- provide a stable anchor for downstream citation and disagreement

The appendix template is intended for use alongside SE-conformant artifacts,
including specifications, formalizations, papers, datasets, and repositories.

It does **not** define domain semantics, evaluation criteria, or enforcement rules.
